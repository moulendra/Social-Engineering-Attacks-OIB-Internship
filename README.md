# Social-Engineering-Attacks-OIB-Internship
This repository contains my research report for Task 5 (Social Engineering Attacks) as part of the Oasis Infobyte Cybersecurity Internship (July-P1 Batch). It covers phishing, pretexting, baiting, real-world case studies, and preventive measures.
# Social Engineering Attacks: A Detailed Report

## 🎯 Objective

To understand the various types of social engineering attacks, analyze real-world case studies, and recommend preventive measures to protect individuals and organizations.

---

## 🧠 What is Social Engineering?

Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. These attacks use psychological tricks to lure victims into giving away confidential data.

## 🧨 Common Types of Social Engineering Attacks

### 1. Phishing
- **Definition**: Tricking individuals into clicking malicious links or providing personal information via fake emails or websites.
- **Example**: A fake email posing as a bank asking for login credentials.
- **Real Case**: In 2020, Twitter was hacked through a phishing scam targeting employees, leading to access of internal tools.

### 2. Pretexting
- **Definition**: Creating a fabricated scenario to steal information or convince someone to act.
- **Example**: An attacker pretending to be IT support asking for passwords.
- **Real Case**: A hacker impersonated a CEO and convinced employees to transfer money to a fake account.

### 3. Baiting
- **Definition**: Offering something enticing (like a free USB or download) to trick users into installing malware.
- **Example**: Leaving infected USB drives in public places labeled “Confidential Salary Info.”
- **Real Case**: Attackers dropped USB drives in a parking lot. Once plugged in, malware infected systems in a government agency.

## 🧪 Case Studies

### 🎯 Target Corporation Data Breach (2013)
- **Method**: Phishing attack on a third-party HVAC vendor.
- **Impact**: 40 million credit card details stolen.
- **Lesson**: Even indirect access can be exploited.

### 🎯 RSA SecurID Attack (2011)
- **Method**: Phishing email titled "2011 Recruitment Plan".
- **Impact**: Led to a major compromise in secure authentication systems.

## 🛡️ Prevention and Recommendations

1. **Employee Awareness Training**: Regular security awareness programs.
2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Adds an extra layer of security.
3. **Email Filtering Tools**: Use anti-phishing tools and spam filters.
4. **Report Suspicious Activity**: Encourage employees to report unusual requests.
5. **Limit Privileges**: Give users only the access they need (Principle of Least Privilege).

## ✅ Conclusion

Social engineering attacks are dangerous because they exploit human behavior rather than technical vulnerabilities. A proactive approach combining employee education and technical safeguards is crucial to defend against these threats.
