## üß† What is Social Engineering?

Social engineering is the psychological manipulation of individuals into performing actions or divulging confidential information. It is one of the most common methods attackers use to gain unauthorized access to systems or data.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Types of Social Engineering Attacks

### 1. Phishing
- **How it works:** Attackers send fraudulent emails or messages pretending to be from reputable sources to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information.
- **Impact:** Data breaches, financial loss, credential theft.
- **Example:** In 2020, Twitter suffered a major breach when attackers used phishing to gain access to admin tools.
- **Mitigation:** Email filters, employee training, multi-factor authentication.

### 2. Pretexting
- **How it works:** Attackers create a fabricated scenario to steal victims‚Äô information or gain access to systems.
- **Impact:** Compromised systems, identity theft.
- **Example:** Attackers posing as IT support requesting login credentials.
- **Mitigation:** Strict identity verification, awareness training.

### 3. Baiting
- **How it works:** Attackers lure victims with promises of goods (like free software or USB drives) to trick them into downloading malware.
- **Impact:** Malware infection, data theft.
- **Example:** Leaving infected USBs in public areas to be picked up and connected to systems.
- **Mitigation:** Disable auto-run, never trust unknown devices.

## üõ°Ô∏è Recommendations to Prevent Social Engineering Attacks

1. Regular cybersecurity awareness training.
2. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA).
3. Use anti-phishing tools and email security filters.
4. Conduct simulated attack exercises.
5. Establish strict policies for data access and verification.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

Social engineering attacks rely more on human error than technical flaws. Understanding these threats and applying proper preventive measures can significantly reduce an organization's risk.
